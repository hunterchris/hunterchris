# Hello! I'm Chris — Lead Engineer (Cloud) based in Berlin

I know many things… and nothing at all

- Currently **Lead Engineer (Cloud)** in the **Platforms** department at **Axel Springer National Media & Tech**.
  
- I take care of everything related to **infrastructure**:
  **deployments, automation, cloud architecture, observability, cost optimization**, and keeping systems healthy and happy.

- Together with the other Lead Engineers, I act as a bridge between **NMT's strategy** and its **technical implementation**:
  
  - Supporting business units in drafting their **technical roadmaps**
    
  - Driving **platform-wide architectural changes** to improve speed, reliability, and business value
    
  - Mentoring engineers and building tools that make their day-to-day work easier

✨ Always learning, always curious.
