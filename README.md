Hello! This is me, I'm a platform Engineer based in Berlin. 
I know many things and nothing at all

- I currently work as Sr DevOps engineer in the Data section of Axel Springer NMT, and I am the Team Lead of the Tracking and Data Infastructure team. (buzzword bingo: DataOps)

- I take care of anything related to infrastructure: Deployment, Automation, Observability, etc.
  
- I also take care of the Tracking platform for the user behavioral data for our German brands.
  
- I build data pipelines to ingest data consistently in our data lake (Palantir Foundry)
