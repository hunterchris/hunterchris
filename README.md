Hello! This is me, I'm a platform Engineer based in Berlin. 
I know many things and nothing at all

- I currently work as Lead engineer (Cloud) in the Platforms department of Axel Springer NMT

- I take care of everything related to infrastructure: Deployment, Automation, Observability, etc.

- Together with the other Lead engineers, we mentor our fellow enginners and build tools to support them in their day to day work
  
- From time to time, I also build data pipelines to ingest data consistently in our data lake (Palantir Foundry)
