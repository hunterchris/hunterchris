Hello! That is me at work. I'm a platform Engineer based in Berlin. 
I know many things and nothing at all

- I'm currently working as DevOps engineer (buzzword bingo: DataOps) in the Data section of Axel Springer NMT.
- I take care of anything related to infrastructure: Deployment, Automation, Observability, etc.
