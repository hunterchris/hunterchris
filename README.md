Hello! This is me, I'm a Sr DevOps engineer based in Berlin. 
I know many things and nothing at all

- I currently work as Lead engineer (Cloud) in the Platforms department of Axel Springer National Media & Tech

- I take care of everything related to infrastructure: Deployment, Automation, Observability, Cost Optimizations, etc.

- Together with the other Lead engineers, we are the bridge between NMT's strategy and its technical implementation.
  - we support the different business units drafting their technical roadmaps
  - we drive architectural changes around Platform to help improving the business units value
  - we mentor our fellow enginners and build tools to support them in their day-to-day work
